# Font Assets

This is the source folder for web font files. The fonts task will copy assets from this folder to the destination path specified in `hive.config.json`.

The **HIVE** platform includes Bootstrap Glyphicons, Fontawesome icons, as well as custom font icons generated by **HIVE**. By default, Bootstrap Glyphicons and Fontawesome icons are hidden within the `_fonts.scss` file.  In order to enable these fonts, simply uncomment the appropriate import statement.

> For more details regarding custom font icons generated from within **HIVE**, click [here](../src/_icons).
